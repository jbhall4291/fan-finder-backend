# :guitar: Fan Finder

## Welcome to Fan Finder!

Fan Finder is a location-based social networking app based on live music gigs, allowing users to find gigs in their area and interact with other music fans.

This project was initially built as part of a team of 4 (big shout out to Team Express!) during the amazing [Northcoders Full-Stack Software Developer Bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/) with the aim of demonstrating & developing the following skills:

* Building a RESTful Web API
* Interacting with Mongo databases
* Developing using TDD 
* Spiking our own choice of technologies
* Developing using pair programming & remote working as part of a small team
* Building a React Native mobile app
* Use of Agile methodologies, inc. Kanban boards and daily Stand Ups
* Implementing the Software Development Lifecycle framework

## Using NC-NEWS

The corresponding frontend for this project can [be found here](https://github.com/jbhall4291/fan-finder-fe), which contains all the information required to get Fan Finder up and running on your device. If you're interested in just the backend, then read on...

A live version of this API can be found here:

https://fanfinder-api-tzm2.onrender.com/api

Please bear in mind this is hosted on a free tier of Render so may take a short while to start.

Alternatively, to run a local copy please ensure you are running node (minimum version 19.5.0) and mongoDB (minimum version 5.1.0), then follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jbhall4291/fan-finder-backend.git
   ```

2. Change into this repos directory:
   ```
   cd fan-finder-backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Go to the MongoDB Atlas website and sign up for an account if you haven't already done so. Once you are signed in, click on the "New Project" button and follow the prompts to create a new project. Give your project a name and select a region for your cluster. Once you have created your project, click on the "Build a Cluster" button to create a new MongoDB cluster. Follow the prompts to configure your cluster. 

5. Once your cluster is created, click on the "Connect" button to get your connection string. This string contains the credentials you will need to connect the Fan Finder backend to your new MongoDB cluster. Copy the connection string and paste it into the Fan Finder backend's .env.development file, which should look like `DEVELOPMENT_DB="<YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE>"`. Double check the .env.development file is in `.gitignore`!
  

6. Go to the "Network Access" section and whitelist the IP addresses that will be used to access the database (e.g., the IP address of the machine running the Fan Finder backend).


7. Use the provided script to set up and seed the dev and test databases.
   ```
   npm run seed
   ```

8. This app has been fully tested with the use of Jest and the Supertest library. To install the necessary dependencies and run the test suite use:
   ```
   npm install -D jest jest-sorted supertest
   npm test
   ```

9. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
